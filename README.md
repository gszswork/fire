# 🔥 FIRE: Fact-checking with Iterative Retrieval and Verification

[FIRE](https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/fire) is a novel agent-based framework for **fact-checking atomic claims**, designed to integrate **evidence retrieval and claim verification** in an **iterative and cost-effective manner**. Unlike traditional systems that fix the number of web queries before verifying, FIRE dynamically decides whether to stop or continue querying based on confidence.

</p>

## 🔍 Why FIRE?

Compared to previous systems like **FACTCHECKGPT**, **FACTOOL**, and **SAFE**, FIRE:
- Integrates reasoning and retrieval instead of separating them
- Dynamically controls the retrieval depth
- Reduces **LLM cost by 7.6×** and **search cost by 16.5×**
- Performs comparably or better on public datasets like FacTool-QA, FELM-WK, BingCheck

## 📌 Features

- **Iterative agent-based reasoning**
- **Unified decision function for retrieval or finalization**
- **Optimized for low-cost verification**
- **Supports both proprietary and open-source LLMs**
- **Extensive evaluations and ablations available**

## 🧠 How It Works

```
Input Claim
   │
   ▼
[FIRE Decision Module]
   ├── confident → Output Label (True / False)
   └── uncertain → Generate Search Query
                      │
                      ▼
          Web Search (via SerperAPI)
                      │
                      ▼
            Update Evidence Set
                      │
                      └── Loop until confident or max steps
```
